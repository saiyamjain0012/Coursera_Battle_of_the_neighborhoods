# Find the perfect location to build a new Cinema in Hong Kong
Capstone Project - The Battle of Neighbourhoods. This is the sample problem that I have taken to solve for this project.

#### "Would you recommend a location in Hong Kong to open a new cinema?"
My boss, the stakeholder wants to **open a new cinema as company's new business**. He wants to invest his money and earn good returns over a long period of time and so wants to choose the locality such that it benefits him the most.

He explains that watching movie is a part of whole afternoon or night activities. The scope of earning money from such a money is huge and so he wants to invest in the same. Cinema should have **many restaurants and shopping places nearby**. Transportation is also an important factor. Customer can walk to cinema within **5 minutes** from **public transport facilities** is perfect.

Upon defining the problem statement, I would be solving the problem by taking the required data and using it to find the most optimal location for opening up a new cinema.

He wants me concentrated on selection of cinema location according to its nearby environment. Cinema facility and rental price is not my concern. He lists out his **top 10 favourite cinemas** in Hong Kong with rating.

I work with my teammates and select **5 possible locations** to build the cinema. Which location should be suggested to the stakeholder?
